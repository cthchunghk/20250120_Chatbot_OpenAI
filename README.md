Use Embedding to ease the api usage.    
Using embedding rather than Fine-tuning is because the FAQs need to be update. In this case, embedding should be more flexible.    

Please use your own API key to use it.    

### Run
1. npm i
2. Replace your API Key in /src/api/openaiConfig.ts
3. npm run start
4. access 127.0.0.1:3000
